Oppenheimer,Full,2023,"[""Biography"", ""Drama"", ""History""]","As America's isolation from World War II ends, prominent American theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer finds himself tasked with performing a miracle. Driven by fear, with the Germans having an overwhelming head start on the race to develop the atomic bomb, the Allies begin the ambitious Manhattan Project. With Oppenheimer at the helm, the Los Alamos Laboratory spearheads a top-secret government endeavour to weaponise theory before the Nazis do. However, nothing can prepare the world for the outcome of the greatest scientific gamble in history: a closely guarded, multibillion-dollar military programme to end all war. After all, no one can be trusted with such a devastating weapon of mass destruction--not even geniuses.","[{""Actor"": ""Cillian Murphy"",""Character"": ""J.

Dunkirk,Full,2017,"[""Action"", ""Drama"", ""History""]","World War II. The enemy forces have cornered four hundred thousand British and French soldiers on the French coast at Dunkirk. A small number of primarily-French soldiers are guarding the perimeter, where the British and French soldiers are amassed, which is getting increasingly smaller as enemy forces advance. Most of those British and French soldiers are now on the beach waiting for destroyers to come and take them back to Britain. Each of the countries are taking care of their own. The British are leaving first and among those the wounded get first priority despite their taking up seven times the space of the able-bodied soldiers. An issue with Dunkirk is that there is only one dock the destroyers can access, which needs to be protected from the enemy bombs. As such, Churchill, newly elected, has put out a call for civilian watercraft to head to Dunkirk both to transport supplies and to transport soldiers from the beach to the destroyers or back to Britain if at all possible. Within this situation, four general stories are told. In one, Commander Bolton, the top British Naval officer on the ground, knows deep in his heart that the soldiers are largely sitting ducks on the beach as the enemy planes fly over. He knows that the situation is a catch-22 for the British in that they need to bring as many soldiers safely home as possible at the depletion of their military resources, which in turn they need to preserve for the day if, but more likely when, the enemies make their way onto British soil. In the second story, a squadron of three Royal Air Force Spitfires are amongst those limited air resources that are embarking in dog fights with enemy planes, while protecting the soldiers on the ground. In the process, they have to ensure their own safety in order to provide what is needed for the ground soldiers, which includes knowing about things like fuel levels and having enough to make their way back to home base whenever required. In the third story, two soldiers meet on the beach, the two of them knowing that the longer they remain on the beach, the likelier they are not to survive this skirmish. As such, they try to do whatever they need to to make it onto one of those destroyers or any other watercraft making its way back to Britain. However, making it aboard a ship does not necessarily ensure their survival, and in the final story, Mr. Dawson, his young-adult son Peter, and their seventeen-year-old friend George are on Dawson's pleasure craft making its way to Dunkirk to do their part in the war effort, all realizing the dangers involved. They have to decide at each step along the way if they will focus on personal problems or if they will continue on to assist in the war, as was their first priority when they left Britain.","[{""Actor"": ""Fionn Whitehead"",""Character"": ""Tommy""},{""Actor"": ""Damien Bonnard"",""Character"": ""French Soldier""},{""Actor"": ""Aneurin Barnard"",""Character"": ""Gibson""},{""Actor"": ""Lee Armstrong"",""Character"": ""Grenadier""},{""Actor"": ""James Bloor"",""Character"": ""Irate Soldier""},{""Actor"": ""Barry Keoghan"",""Character"": ""George""},{""Actor"": ""Mark Rylance"",""Character"": ""Mr. Dawson""},{""Actor"": ""Tom Glynn-Carney"",""Character"": ""Peter""},{""Actor"": ""Tom Hardy"",""Character"": ""Farrier""},{""Actor"": ""Jack Lowden"",""Character"": ""Collins""},{""Actor"": ""Fionn Whitehead"",""Character"": ""Tommy""},{""Actor"": ""Damien Bonnard"",""Character"": ""French Soldier""},{""Actor"": ""Aneurin Barnard"",""Character"": ""Gibson""},{""Actor"": ""Lee Armstrong"",""Character"": ""Grenadier""},{""Actor"": ""James Bloor"",""Character"": ""Irate Soldier""},{""Actor"": ""Barry Keoghan"",""Character"": ""George""},{""Actor"": ""Mark Rylance"",""Character"": ""Mr. Dawson""},{""Actor"": ""Tom Glynn-Carney"",""Character"": ""Peter""},{""Actor"": ""Tom Hardy"",""Character"": ""Farrier""},{""Actor"": ""Jack Lowden"",""Character"": ""Collins""}]",7.8,92.0

The Prestige,Full,2006,"[""Drama"", ""Mystery"", ""Sci-fi""]","In nineteenth century London, illusionist Alfred Borden is on trial for the murder of fellow illusionist, Robert Angier. Borden's indictment is largely possible because of the eyewitness account of John Cutter, who saw Borden backstage in the area where Angier was killed. At the end of one of his shows, Angier fell through a trap door in the stage floor into a clear water-filled tank below, that tank which was a prop for one of Angier's tricks performed earlier in the show. Angier ended up drowning, as the tank was locked after he fell into it. Borden, Angier, and Cutter have a shared largely turbulent history, which also provides motive. Early in their magic careers, both Borden and Angier worked under ""Milton the Magician"", while Angier's wife Julia worked as his on-stage assistant, and Cutter as his ingénieur, staging the tricks and providing the apparatus required, work that he still does for others. Based on a specific incident during this stage of their relationship led to both Borden and Angier striking out, creating their own shows, and them having a feud, which was not only in the professional realm, but a personal one, where each man wanted to ruin the other. While Borden is arguably more accomplished in the technical aspects of the illusions, Angier is the more accomplished showman. In the professional realm, they tried to outdo each other, especially in the illusions considered either the most dangerous and/or mysterious, those two being catching-the-bullet trick, and more so, the transported man trick. In the process of their feud, they seemingly were not averse to any means, even with collateral damage of others. The question is if those means extend to murder, especially of the other.","[{""Actor"": ""Hugh Jackman"", ""Character"": ""Robert Angier""},{""Actor"": ""Christian Bale"", ""Character"": ""Alfred Borden""},{""Actor"": ""Michael Caine"", ""Character"": ""Cutter""},{""Actor"": ""Piper Perabo"", ""Character"": ""Julia McCullough""},{""Actor"": ""Rebecca Hall"", ""Character"": ""Sarah""},{""Actor"": ""Scarlett Johanson"", ""Character"": ""Plivia Wenscombe""},{""Actor"": ""Samantha Mahurin"", ""Character"": ""Jess""},{""Actor"": ""David Bowie"", ""Character"": ""Tesla""},{""Actor"": ""Andy Serkis"", ""Character"": ""Alley""},{""Actor"": ""Daniel Davis"", ""Character"": ""Judge""},{""Actor"": ""Jim Piddock"", ""Character"": ""Prosecutor""},{""Actor"": ""Christopher Neame"", ""Character"": ""Defender""},{""Actor"": ""MArk Ryan"", ""Character"": ""Captain""},{""Actor"": ""Roger Rees"", ""Character"": ""Owens""},{""Actor"": ""JAmie Harris"", ""Character"": ""Warder""},{""Actor"": ""Monty Stuart"", ""Character"": ""Stagecoach Driver""},{""Actor"": ""Ron Perkins"", ""Character"": ""Hotel Manager""},{""Actor"": ""Ricky Jay"", ""Character"": ""Milton""},{""Actor"": ""J.

Inception,Full,2010,"[""Action"", ""Adventure"", ""Sci-fi""]","Dominic Cobb is the foremost practitioner of the artistic science of extraction, inserting oneself into a subject's dreams to obtain hidden information without the subject knowing, a concept taught to him by his professor father-in-law, Dr. Stephen Miles. Dom's associates are Miles' former students, who Dom requires as he has given up being the dream architect for reasons he won't disclose. Dom's primary associate, Arthur, believes it has something to do with Dom's deceased wife, Mal, who often figures prominently and violently in those dreams, or Dom's want to ""go home"" (get back to his own reality, which includes two young children). Dom's work is generally in corporate espionage. As the subjects don't want the information to get into the wrong hands, the clients have zero tolerance for failure. Dom is also a wanted man, as many of his past subjects have learned what Dom has done to them. One of those subjects, Mr. Saito, offers Dom a job he can't refuse: to take the concept one step further into inception, namely planting thoughts into the subject's dreams without them knowing. Inception can fundamentally alter that person as a being. Saito's target is Robert Michael Fischer, the heir to an energy business empire, which has the potential to rule the world if continued on the current trajectory. Beyond the complex logistics of the dream architecture of the case and some unknowns concerning Fischer, the biggest obstacles in success for the team become worrying about one aspect of inception which Cobb fails to disclose to the other team members prior to the job, and Cobb's newest associate Ariadne's belief that Cobb's own subconscious, especially as it relates to Mal, may be taking over what happens in the dreams.","[{""Actor"": ""Leonardo DiCaprio"", ""Character"": ""Cobb""},{""Actor"": ""Joseph Gordon-Levitt"", ""Character"": ""Arthur""},{""Actor"": ""Elliot Page"", ""Character"": ""Ariadne (as Ellen Page)""},{""Actor"": ""Tom Hardy"", ""Character"": ""Eames""},{""Actor"": ""Ken Watanabe"", ""Character"": ""Saito""},{""Actor"": ""Dileep Rao"", ""Character"": ""Yusuf""},{""Actor"": ""Cillian Murphy"", ""Character"": ""Robert Fischer""},{""Actor"": ""Tom Berenger"", ""Character"": ""Browning""},{""Actor"": ""Marion Cotillard"", ""Character"": ""Mal""},{""Actor"": ""Pete Postlethwaite"", ""Character"": ""Maurice Fischer""},{""Actor"": ""Michael Caine"", ""Character"": ""Miles""},{""Actor"": ""Lukas Haas"", ""Character"": ""Nash""},{""Actor"": ""Tai-Li Lee"", ""Character"": ""Tadashi""}]",8.8,87.0
